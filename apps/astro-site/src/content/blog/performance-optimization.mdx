# Building Performant Web Applications

Performance is crucial for modern web applications. Users expect fast loading times and smooth interactions, and search engines favor well-optimized sites.

## Key Performance Metrics

### Core Web Vitals
- **Largest Contentful Paint (LCP)**: Measures loading performance
- **First Input Delay (FID)**: Measures interactivity
- **Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS)**: Measures visual stability

## Optimization Strategies

### 1. Asset Optimization
- Compress and optimize images
- Use modern image formats (WebP, AVIF)
- Implement lazy loading for images and components

### 2. Code Splitting
- Split your JavaScript bundles
- Load only what's needed for each page
- Use dynamic imports for heavy components

### 3. Caching Strategies
- Implement proper HTTP caching headers
- Use service workers for offline functionality
- Leverage CDN for static assets

## Tools for Performance Monitoring

- **Lighthouse**: Comprehensive performance auditing
- **Web Vitals Extension**: Real-time Core Web Vitals monitoring
- **Performance API**: Programmatic performance measurement

Remember, performance optimization is an ongoing process. Regular monitoring and testing are essential for maintaining fast, user-friendly applications.
